# ðŸª§ Special Note

::: warning
All time-related methods can accept time in any format or timestamp. However, please note that for dates in the format of m/d/y or d-m-y, if the separator is a slash (/), the American m/d/y format is used. If the separator is a hyphen (-) or a dot (.), the European d-m-y format is used. To avoid potential errors, it is recommended to use the YYYY-MM-DD format or other formats as much as possible.
